This is a game where you can test how fast you type. To get started open your command prompt and head over to the directory where your files from this repo are located (mine
would be "cd desktop/project"). Once your in the directory type in "Python work.py" and that should open it. press either 1 or 2 to select the level and start typing. Get 
everything right inorder for the game to end.
